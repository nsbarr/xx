1) feels rushed
2) slow down
3) needs to breathe more. live in the scenes longer...
4) go along at a rolling pace, then crescendo into a point where the story can't be held back (act 3)

5) Mei Mei manic pixie (happy go lucky)?

For each scene: What's the heart of this scene? Who's it about? Why am I writing it? What do I want people to remember about it?


Cartoony moments

Make sure the stakes are real to me. Eg., scene with Director, where he threatens to fire Lu Bu, doesn't feel real. Real conflicts. 

Break up the action scenes. More paragraphs, more whitespace.
