# Xiang Xiang

Our hero, the protagonist. This is his story.

# Paul

Xiang Xiang's adoptive father and trainer. Knows the secret of Xiang Xiang's family but hides it for his own good.

# Father

A massive, sulking great panda who lives in a cage in the high-security section of the Preserve. Not allowed to leave without supervision. Totally wild, despises captivity. Does not acknowledge Xiang Xiang as his son. (Xiang Xiang thinks this is because he blames him for his mother's death, actually because seeing his son grow up weak and in captivity breaks his heart) 

# Mother

Dead, as far as Xiang Xiang knows. Actually sold to the Zoo after giving birth to Xiang Xiang on the Preserve. Beatiful, mysterious, possibly insane after years of isolation in a cage. (Galadriel/Jenova) 

# The Director

Runs the Preserve, totally corrupt. In it for the money. Sold Xiang Xiang's Mother to the Zoo because she would not have been able to bear more children.   

# Other Zoo animals

TBD. Could be some room for fun here when Mother breaks out of the Zoo.

# Twin Brother

TBD. Apparently Xiang Xiang had a twin brother; "wild twin brother" could be an interesting storyline; maybe he's at the Zoo with Mother?

# Love interest?

TBD. Maybe there isn't one.
