I.

Wolong Nature Preserve. Hot summer morning. Cicadas. Baby pandas are playing on a slide. Two elder pandas groom each other methodically. An infant panda sneezes loudly in its mother's lap, startling her.

The young pandas are playing a game of soccer. Xiang Xiang is last to be picked. He plays goalie and the team complains as he lets in goal after goal.

A ball sails past him and comes to rest by the fence at the border of the Reserve. As he retrieves it he is surprised to see another panda's face, female, wild red eyes, looking in at him from the other side of the fence. As Xiang Xiang starts to say something the face disappears back into the wild.

Paul calls for a break and the pandas gather around the water pool for a drink. There's no room for Xiang Xiang. He climbs into Paul's lap and Paul gives him water from a water bottle. 

Xiang Xiang asks Paul why the other pandas don't like him. Paul deflects the question, insists they do. Lu Bu, the bully of the pandas, overhears and tells Xiang Xiang exactly why: because he's a shrimp, because he's a teacher's pet, and because his mother is dead and his father's a drunk. The other pandas laugh.

Later that evening Xiang Xiang has a restless sleep. He has a recurring dream, his mother is being pulled away into darkness, into a void, and Xiang Xiang, still a baby, can only mewl and watch in confusion.

Xiang Xiang awakes with a start. It's the middle of the night. He takes a long melancholy walk, and reaches the high-security section of the Reserve. He begins to turn back when he hears a loud, wailing roar echoing off the walls. He pursues the sound and walks past the security guard, who has fallen asleep at his station. The TV is on. A news anchor is reporting on structural problems with the Three Gorges Dam.

Xiang Xiang locates the source of the roars — it's his estranged father, Xiang Bo, locked inside a cage. He's surrounded by empty beer cans and cracks another one open with his feet and athletically tosses it into his mouth. Xiang Bo begins verbally abusing his son — calling him a weakling, a pet, a pathetic end to the Xiang family line. 

Xiang Xiang, in tears, is about to leave when his father calls him back. Xiang Bo asks him how old he is and Xiang Xiang answers 3. It's time you knew the truth, Xiang Bo says.

Xiang Bo tells his son how they came to the Reserve. We see a flashback to the wild, where Xiang Bo and a very pregnant Su Lin are surrounded in the wild by the Director, Paul, and other Reserve employees. They are tranquilized, loaded on to a truck, and brought back to the Reserve. 

Days later Xiang Bo is locked in a cage and Su Lin has just given birth to Xiang Xiang. The Director is negotiation with a man over Su Lin. We see that he is trying to sell her and Xiang Xiang to the Circus. The Circus manager is interested in Su Lin but says he can't do anything with a runt like Xiang Xiang. They shake hands, money is exchanged, and a still-drowsy Su Lin is shoved into a sack while a baby Xiang Xiang whimpers — the source of his recurring dream.

The flashback ends. Xiang Xiang is speechless. Xiang Bo tells Xiang Xiang if he has any honor at all he will leave the Reserve and go find out if his Mother is alive or dead.

It's the next day and the Director is conducting a press conference at the Reserve. He announces the Reintegration Program, a high-profile and well-funded project to release the first panda bred in captivity back into the wild. 

After the press conference the Director has Paul line up all the pandas in Xiang Xiang's class. He asks who is brave enough to volunteer for the Program. To no one's surprise, the bully Lu Bu steps forward. To everyone's surprise, so does Xiang Xiang. 

Delighted, the Director instructs Paul to begin the training regime and gives him a tiny budget for it.

Paul tries to get Xiang Xiang's attention but Xiang Xiang ignores him. He grabs Xiang Xiang's shoulder and Xiang Xiang, snarling,  tells him never to speak to him or touch him again, that he knows the truth.

{Training Sequence}

The Director, impatient to continue the Program, tells Lu Bu he needs to complete the training by the end of the day. Lu Bu counters that they are totally unprepared, and that neither panda is ready. The Director wants to see for himself. He calls them both to the center of the sand pit, where we previously saw baby pandas playing, and instructs them to fight.

Xiang Xiang defeats Lu Bu and has to be pulled off him before he kills him. The Director is overjoyed and congratulates Xiang Xiang on being selected for reintegration. The release ceremony will be tomorrow morning.

Paul slips into Xiang Xiang's bunk and speaks to him in his sleep.He explains why he never told Xiang Xiang the truth about his Mother, tells him that the Director sold his mother behind his back, tells him that he is full of regret. We see that Xiang Xiang is awake, but pretends to be asleep.

The next morning the entire Reserve is lined up to send off Xiang Xiang. Somber marching music plays as Xiang Xiang walks toward the open gate. He ignores everyone — his classmates, Lu Bu, Paul. {Xiang Bo is...}

At the same time, we jump to the Circus where Su Lin is. An earthquake wakes up the animals and we hear a cacophony of sounds.The earthquake ends and there is brief silence, before we realize the Dam has broken. Water floods the Circus, destroying the cages.Su Lin and the other animals that survive are now free.

Xiang Xiang steps into the wild and as the Reserve disappears behind him the thick forest envelops him.

II.

Night in the forest. Xiang Xiang hears a cacophony of strange noises. {Does he also feel earthquake then? How far away is he?}. Shivering, he creates a makeshift bed out of leaves and lies down to sleep. We see a pair of red eyes watching him.

{Fun & Games}

Mei Mei is chewing meditatively on some bamboo when Xiang Xiang sneaks behind her and grabs it. They wrestle for the bamboo and Mei Mei, panting on top of Xiang Xiang, realizes she has feelings for him. Long beat before she pulls herself away from him.

Mei Mei tells Xiang Xiang there's someone she wants him to meet. There's another panda, further down the river, with a small army of wild animals. Xiang Xiang, intrigued, agrees to make the trip.

{Approach the Camp}

{A Grim Reunion}

{Escape! Mei Mei Stays Behind.}

III. 
Xiang Xiang unconscious in a forest clearing. The three monkeys are poking at him, performing mock-CPR, bouncing on his chest, giving mouth-to-mouth, using shock paddles. He comes to with a start. He is hurt but shakes himself off. No bones broken.

He realizes he has to go back to the Nature Reserve to warn Paul about the siege. As he does, Paul arrives with Lu Bu. A moment of awkwardness as they both struggle with what to say. Xiang Xiang breaks the silence. The Reserve is in grave danger, and it's Su Lin leading the charge.

Xiang Xiang hops into the jeep, as do the 3 monkeys, and they race off, back to the Reserve. 

As they approach they see smoke billowing out of the Reserve and the sounds of gunfire. The fight is well underway. A lion jumps at the throat of a security guard. An elephant stomps down a barracks. Zebras infiltrate and destroy the control center, releasing Xiang Bo and all the other animals in high security from their cages.

Su Lin breaks her way into the baby panda center. An officer tries to block her way from their cages but is knocked out. Su Lin busts open the baby's cages, thinking she has liberated them. The babies, confused and afraid, start mewling. Mei Mei begins to see that Su Lin's mission of liberation is flawed and that Xiang Xiang was right about the humans. Infuriated, Su Lin grabs one of the pandas with her teeth and flings it out of the cage; it flies perilously high and lands... in the arms of Paul.

Paul gently places the baby panda down and it scurries away.

Su Lin poised to attack Paul.

The Director shoots Su Lin.

Xiang Bo attacks The Director.

Paul allows Xiang Bo to kill The Director.

Su Lin tells Xiang Xiang to save Mei Mei.

Xiang Bo holds Su Lin and she dies in his arms.

Xiang Xiang drags Mei Mei out from the fire. She wakes up.

Su Lin is dead by the time Xiang Xiang returns to her side.

Xiang Xiang and Xiang Bo mourn together as Paul and Mei Mei watch The zoo animals slink away. The Reserve is a smoldering mess.

The Reserve. Hot summer morning. Cicadas chirping. Years have passed. Buildings are broken down, covered in moss. The Director's house is a modest lodge. Xiang Xiang and Mei Mei are nursing their baby girl. Her name is Su Lin. 

She starts crying, Mei Mei says she wants her grandpa. Xiang Bo and Paul emerge. They playfully toss her back and forth as she coos and her adoring parents smile.
