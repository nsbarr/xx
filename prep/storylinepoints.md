# Disunity
Young Xiang Xiang is the runt of his class on the Preserve. Desperate for friendship, he tries to participate in games but is ostracized by the other pandas. He seeks the protection of his trainer and adoptive father, Paul. 

# Deconstruction
When he learns the truth from his father, Xiang Xiang's world falls apart. He breaks ties with Paul, who knew everything. Xiang Xiang gives up on finding happiness on the Preserve; he becomes distant, hermetic, and focuses all his energy on getting out.

# Reconstruction
A year of intense training and Xiang Xiang has now matured into an adolescent panda. He has become fiercely independent and relies on no one â€” he's come a long way from his clingy childhood. Rage at being lied to and a quest to find his Mother are what fuels him; he leaves the Preserve as part of the reintegration program and begins adulthood.

# Unity
Xiang Xiang finally finds his Mother, only to discover that she can't resolve any of his problems. She herself is blind with rage against the Preserve, and in her he only sees his own pain metastasized. Rather than join her in a campaign of revenge, he sets out to build his own home in the wild, finally free.
