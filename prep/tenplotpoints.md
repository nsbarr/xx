#Act I

##The Opening
Open to the Wolong Nature Preserve, Sichuan China. Hot summer morning. Cicadas. Baby pandas are playing on a slide. Two elder pandas groom each other methodically. An infant panda sneezes loudly in its mother's lap, startling her. 

When we come to Xiang Xiang he is being picked last for a game of soccer. The captains of the two teams are arguing which team is going to be stuck with him. Finally he gets put in as the goalie.

A ball sails past him and comes to rest by the fence at the border of the Preserve. As he picks it up he is surprised to see another panda's face, wild, almost mirror-like, looking in from the other side of the fence. As Xiang Xiang starts to say something the face disappears back into the wild.

##The Hook
Xiang Xiang takes a long melancholy walk at dusk. He reaches the high-security section of the Preserve and begins to turn back when he hears a loud, wailing roar echoing off the walls. He pursues the sound. It belongs to his estranged father, Xiang Bo, locked inside a small cage. 

They talk — for the first time — and Bo tells Xiang Xiang the truth about his Mother. She didn't die during childbirth, as he'd been told. Instead, the Director of the Preserve sold her to the Zoo and locked Bo away.

Xiang Bo urges his son to leave the Preserve.

##The Lock
The Director announces the Reintegration Program, a high-profile project to release a panda bred in captivity back into the wild. To everyone's shock Xiang Xiang volunteers. He enters a period of intense training during which he breaks off all ties with the Preserve. When his training completes he is no longer a child. He leaves the Preserve and enters the Wild alone.

#Act II

##The Deconstruction Test
Xiang Xiang's training can't prepare him for the wild. He struggles to forage for food. When he does, three mischievious monkeys steal it from him. He sleeps under a boulder, cold, exposed and hungry.

##The Transition
Xiang Xiang wakes at dawn to find a female panda (Ehuang) tiptoing away from his camp. He recognizes her as the panda whose face he saw at the Preserve. She has been leaving him food.

##The Reconstruction Test
Maybe Xiang Xiang teams up with Ehuang, sets up a home, gets revenge on the three monkeys who end up becoming pals with them.

##All is Lost
One morning Xiang Xiang and Ehuang get attacked by some jaguars and knocked out. When he comes to he is surrounded by a variety of wild animals. It turns out this is a group of animals that broke out of the zoo, led by Xiang Xiang's mother. They are on a mission to take revenge on the humans who enslaved them. Xiang Xiang has a long conversation with his mother, who has been transformed by hate into someone that hardly resembles the mother of his dreams. She urges Xiang Xiang to join her on her campaign.

#Act III

##On the Offensive



##Final Struggle
At the Nature Preserve, Paul has been monitoring Xiang Xiang's activity via GPS and realizes something is wrong when Xiang Xiang gets knocked out. He sets off to track him down. When he arrives, he sees Xiang Xiang fighting one of the wild Zoo pandas. After a standoff between Xiang Xiang & Ehuang / Paul / Mother & the zoo animals, Paul tells Xiang Xiang to run. He does so, Mother attacks, Paul fires his gun, and we see Xiang Xiang & Ehuang run off with a cacophony of sounds behind them.

##Denouement
We see a much older Xiang Xiang and Ehuang, living peacefully in the forest, having started a family?
