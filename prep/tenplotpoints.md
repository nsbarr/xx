#Act I

##The Opening
Open to the Wolong Nature Preserve, Sichuan China. Hot summer morning. Cicadas. Baby pandas are playing on a slide. Two elder pandas groom each other methodically. An infant panda sneezes loudly in its mother's lap, startling her. 

When we come to Xiang Xiang he is being picked last for a game of soccer. The captains of the two teams are arguing which team is going to be stuck with him. Finally he gets put in as the goalie.

A ball sails past him and comes to rest by the fence at the border of the Preserve. As he picks it up he is surprised to see a face, wild, almost mirror-like, looking in from the other side of the fence. As Xiang Xiang starts to say something the face disappears back into the wild.

##The Hook
Xiang Xiang takes a long melancholy walk at dusk. He reaches the high-security section of the Preserve and begins to turn back when he hears a loud, wailing roar echoing off the walls. He pursues the sound. It belongs to his estranged father, Xiang Bo, locked inside a small cage. 

They talk — for the first time — and Bo tells Xiang Xiang the truth about his Mother. She didn't die during childbirth, as he'd been told. Instead, the Director of the Preserve sold her to the Zoo and locked Bo away.

Bo Xiang urges his son to leave the Preserve.

##The Lock
The Director announces the Reintegration Program, a high-profile project to release a panda bred in captivity back into the wild. To everyone's shock Xiang Xiang volunteers. He enters a period of intense training during which he breaks off all ties with the Preserve. When his training completes he is no longer a child. He leaves the Preserve and enters the Wild alone.

##The Deconstruction Test
Xiang Xiang's training can't prepare him for the wild. He struggles to forage for food. When he does, three mischievious monkeys steal it from him. He sleeps under a boulder, cold, exposed and hungry.

##The Transition
Xiang Xiang wakes at dawn to find a female panda tiptoing away from his camp. He recognizes her as the panda whose face he saw at the Preserve. She has been leaving him food.

##The Reconstruction Test
Maybe Xiang Xiang teams up with the female panda, sets up a home, gets revenge on the three monkeys who end up becoming pals with them.

##All is Lost
This is where I think Xiang Xiang gets attacked by some wild pandas and knocked out.

Well this isn't really the offensive so much, but I think when Xiang Xiang comes to
