# Xiang Xiang

Our hero, the protagonist. This is his story.

# Paul

Xiang Xiang's adoptive father and trainer. Knows the secret of Xiang Xiang's family but hides it for his own good.

# Xiang Bo

A massive, sulking great panda who lives in a cage in the high-security section of the Preserve. Totally wild, despises captivity. His captors find that throwing him beer cans are the only way to placate him. Does not acknowledge Xiang Xiang as his son.  

# Su Lin

Xiang Xiang's mother. Dead, as far as Xiang Xiang knows. Actually sold to the Circus after giving birth to Xiang Xiang on the Reserve. Beatiful, mysterious, possibly insane after years of isolation.

# The Director

Runs the Reserve, totally corrupt. Believes that as long as the Reserve meets its goals he can pocket the revenue. He secretly sells Su Lin to the Circus. He also pilots the under-funded and over-rushed Reintegration Program to send a panda bred in captivity into the wild.

# Lu Bu

The alpha male of Xiang Xiang's class at the Reserve and his relentless bully. Like Xiang Xiang, he volunteers for the Reintegration Program and is favored to be selected.

# Mei Mei

A wild female panda who secretly follows Xiang Xiang and eventually befriends him. Poachers killed her father(?) and she is a human-hater. She hears about Su Lin and is the one to introduce Xiang Xiang, hoping to recruit him on a campaign of revenge and not realizing the relationship they have.

# Three Monkeys

Mischieveous wild monkeys that initially torment, and later befriend Xiang Xiang

# Other Circus animals

Lions, zebras, an elephant all subservient to Su Lin. They call her Mother.
