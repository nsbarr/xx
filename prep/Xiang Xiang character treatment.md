# Who is Xiang Xiang?

Xiang Xiang is our protagonist and a young giant panda, born and raised on the Wolong Nature Preserve in the Sichuan Province of China.

Xiang Xiang is estranged from his Father, who lives in a high-security part of the Preserve and never adjusted to life in captivity. Xiang Xiang never knew his Mother.

Instead, Xiang Xiang's family is his human trainer, Paul, and the other young pandas on the Preserve. Xiang Xiang is particularly close with Paul, and considers him a father figure.

Life on the Preserve for a young panda is like an endless summer camp; Xiang Xiang and his classmates spend their days climbing trees, playing games, learning skills. But Xiang Xiang, who is the smallest, weakest, and most timid of the class, often finds himself excluded from these events, choosing to watch on the sideline in Paul's arms. As a result, he earns the reputation of being a shrimp, and a teacher's pet.

# What does Xiang Xiang want?

Xiang Xiang wants to belong, to be liked, to feel comfortable with other pandas and maybe even popular. 

He wants to have friends.

# What does Xiang Xiang need?

Xiang Xiang needs to know the truth about his family and the conditions under which which they were brought to the Preserve. 

He needs to know about the real world outside the Preserve. He needs to make sense of the world and his place in it. 

He needs to realize his potential.

# What's keeping Xiang Xiang from his goals?

The Preserve and the people who run it are, for innocent and nefarious reasons, keeping Xiang Xiang from his goals.

Xiang Xiang thinks his mother died during childbirth. This is a lie. The truth is that immediately after giving birth to Xiang Xiang she was sold to the zoo, torn apart from her family and sending Xiang Xiang's father into heartbroken depression.

The walls of the Preserve create a barrier between Xiang Xiang and the world he needs to explore; between captivity and the wild.

And the wardens of the Preserve create a similar barrier to the truth: the Director, who sold Xiang Xiang's mother, Paul, who hides the truth from Xiang Xiang for his own sake, and Xiang Xiang's father, who won't even acknowledge his son and blames him for the breaking apart of their family.

# Why now?

Xiang Xiang is reaching the age where his loneliness and alienation from the rest of his classmates is becoming unbearably painful. He's looking for happiness on the Preserve, but a chance encounter with his Father will render that an impossibility.
